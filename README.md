# IIITB-LMS-Client
Unofficial client for LMS - IIITB

Development stopped. Checkout https://github.com/zeroby0/lms-scraper. Written in javascript and considerably faster.

this is the stable branch, switch to `current` for latest (also probably unstable) version.

Clone the repo and submit your pull requests or head over to [issues](https://github.com/zeroby0/IIITB-LMS-Client/issues) if you find any bugs.

Libraries used:  
Jaunt - for scraping LMS  
Derby - database  

GUI - JavaFX, FXML

net beans workspace under branch `nbeans-project`. This project doesn't work right now [In my system. The same setup worked in some other systems.] Nor are there any plans to continue work on this project, in the foreseeable future.  
However, I'll try to make another LMS client with nodejs and electron in coming holidays.

Thanks
