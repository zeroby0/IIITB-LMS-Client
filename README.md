# IIITB-LMS-Client
Unofficial client for LMS - IIITB
Development under progress

this is the stable branch, switch to `current` for latest (also probably unstable) version.

Clone the repo and submit your pull requests or head over to [issues](https://github.com/zeroby0/IIITB-LMS-Client/issues) if you find any bugs.

Libraries used:  
Jaunt - for scraping LMS  
Derby - database  

GUI - JavaFX, FXML

update: I'm working on a better `readme` that includes setup and I'll convert the repo to a clonable `workspace` so you can get started on the project or package it rightaway.

Thanks
